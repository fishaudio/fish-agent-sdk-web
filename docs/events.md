# Events

Subscribe with `session.on(event, listener)`, `off`, and `once`, or pass `callbacks` at start. Each `onXxx` key subscribes the `xxx` event, so `onUserTranscript` subscribes `userTranscript`. An unknown key makes `start()` throw a `TypeError`.

| Event | Payload | Fired when |
|---|---|---|
| `connect` | `{ sessionId }` | The realtime session is established. |
| `disconnect` | `{ reason: EndReason }` | The session ended, by anyone. Terminal. |
| `statusChange` | `SessionStatus` | `"connecting" → "connected" ⇄ "reconnecting" → "ended"` |
| `modeChange` | `AgentMode` | `"listening" \| "thinking" \| "speaking"`. Drives a talking-orb UI. |
| `userTranscript` | `{ segmentId, text, final }` | Live transcription of the user. |
| `agentResponseDelta` | `{ segmentId, delta, text }` | Streaming agent speech text (playout-synced). |
| `agentResponse` | `{ segmentId, text }` | Agent speech segment finalized. |
| `message` | `{ role, text }` | Finalized messages only, in order. A ready-made chat log. |
| `toolCallStarted` | `{ callId, toolName, source, input, inputTruncated }` | The agent started running a tool. |
| `toolCallCompleted` | `{ callId, toolName, source, output, outputTruncated }` | The tool returned a result. |
| `toolCallFailed` | `{ callId, toolName, source, error }` | The tool errored. |
| `error` | `FishAgentError` | A recoverable error occurred (the session may still be live). |

## Live transcripts

Both transcript streams send the **whole segment so far**. Replace the segment's text on each event. Do not append.

- `userTranscript` may reword earlier text as interim recognition improves. `final: true` pins the segment. `segmentId` identifies which segment to update.
- `agentResponseDelta` carries `delta`, the new fragment, and `text`, the accumulated segment. `agentResponse` fires once when the segment completes. Agent text is paced with audio playout, so an interrupted reply finalizes with only what was actually spoken. A reply that spans multiple speech segments, for example around a tool call, arrives as multiple segments.

If you only need finalized messages in order (no streaming updates), subscribe to `message` instead. In React, [`useAgentMessages`](react/useAgentMessages.md) does this aggregation for you.

A listener attached late misses events fired before it subscribed. To backfill, call `session.getTranscript()`. It returns every segment so far as `{ segmentId, role, text, final }` in conversation order. Then keep applying live events by `segmentId`.

## Tool call lifecycle

Every tool the agent runs emits one `toolCallStarted`. That covers webhook, MCP, built-in, and [client tools](client-tools.md). Exactly one `toolCallCompleted` or `toolCallFailed` with the same `callId` resolves it. Terminal events repeat `toolName` and `source`, so a listener attached mid-call can still render a complete item. `input` and `output` are JSON strings truncated at 4 KB. Parse them only when the matching `*Truncated` flag is `false`.

These events stream by default, and they carry tool arguments and results into the end user's browser. To keep tool data hidden, create the session with `toolEvents: false` for a public agent, or with `tool_events: false` on your backend's session-creation call. See [Sessions](sessions.md).

## Delivery notes

- Events emitted during a [reconnection](sessions.md#reconnection) gap are dropped, not replayed. A transcript may skip turns lost to the outage.
- Unknown server events are ignored by design. Old SDK versions keep working as the protocol grows.
