# @fishaudio/agent-widget

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- b05db7d: Republish with resolved internal dependency ranges. The 0.2.0 tarballs declared their `@fishaudio/*` dependencies with the `workspace:^` protocol, which npm cannot install; packing and publishing now go through pnpm only, and a release-time check verifies the packed manifests.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d64ffb4: Typed turns now default to a text-only reply. `sendUserMessage(text)` sends `audio: false` unless called with `{ audio: true }`, so the agent answers typed input as streaming transcript text without synthesizing speech. Previously the default was a spoken reply and `{ audio: false }` was the opt-out. The widget follows the new default: typed messages in the widget also get a text-only reply. The wire protocol is unchanged — an absent `audio` field still means a spoken reply for raw-protocol clients.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Revise `SessionOverrides`: rename `voice_profile_id` to `voice_id`, add `first_message_prompt` (mutually exclusive with `first_message`), and move the language override fully into `overrides.language` — the top-level `language` request field is gone. The `language` start option still works and now folds into overrides client-side; an explicit `overrides.language` wins. Keyless (public) session creation accepts only the `language` and `voice_id` overrides.
